### ðŸ”§ Configuration

Before running, change a `core/config.py` file with the following variables:

```python
SECRET_KEY = "your_secret_key_here"
ALGORITHM = "HS256"
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES = 30
```

Or you can create a `.env` file with the following variables:

```
SECRET_KEY = "your_secret_key_here"
ALGORITHM = "HS256"
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES = 30
```
